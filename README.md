nycCheapEats is my first ever full stack web application and it is built on the MERN stack (Mongodb, Express, React.js, and Node.js)

This web app functions as a curated catalog of cheap restaurants to eat at in New York City, and although there will not be many restaurants in the database on launch date
I hope to grow it moving forward as this is a topic of great personal interest to me.

Hope launch this app on the cloud this week (July 7-13 2024) I will update this readme as the status of this project changes.

If you're reading this thank you.
