      <h1>About NYC CHEAP EATS</h1>

      <p>Hi everyone thank you for checking out my website. My name is Matthew and nyc cheap eats is a small passion project of mine
        mostly made for the purpose of helping me keep track of all the cheap restaurants I want to eat at or 
        have eatten at in nyc. As a student I want to stretch my dollar as much as possible when going out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still learning the ins and outs of web-development and I plan on expanding on this sight in the future. Adding more restaurants
        and features to the site, including a better mobile UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ocassionally this site may go down time to time as I experiment with different ways to host this so it is avaiable for all to see.
        But I plan on keeping all the source code for this project available on my github at https://github.com/ham70 if anyone is interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have a great day! :D
      </p>
